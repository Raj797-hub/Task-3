# Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan

## Overview
This repository contains the results of a vulnerability assessment performed on a personal computer as part of Task 3 of the Elevate Cyber Security Internship.

## Objective
Use free vulnerability scanning tools to identify common vulnerabilities on a personal computer and document findings.

## Tools Used
- *Zoho Patch Manager* - Enterprise patch management and vulnerability scanning solution
- *Agent Version*: 11.4.2520.01.W
- *Scan Date*: May 30, 2025 11:49 AM (Asia/Calcutta)

## System Information
- *Computer Name*: DESKTOP-6A5FE9O
- *Domain*: WORKGROUP
- *Agent Status*: Installed Successfully
- *Last Boot Time*: May 19, 2025 08:28 AM

## Scan Results
### Summary
The vulnerability scan completed successfully with *no critical vulnerabilities detected*. This indicates a well-maintained system with up-to-date security patches.

### Key Findings
- ✅ *Scan Status*: Completed Successfully
- ✅ *Vulnerabilities Found*: None
- ✅ *System Security*: Good security posture maintained
- ✅ *Patch Level*: System appears to be fully patched

## Analysis
The absence of vulnerabilities suggests:
1. *Regular Updates*: System is receiving timely security updates
2. *Good Maintenance*: Proper system administration practices
3. *Security Awareness*: Proactive approach to cybersecurity
4. *Patch Management*: Effective patch deployment strategy

## Security Recommendations
Even with clean scan results, continuous security practices are recommended:

### Preventive Measures
1. *Regular Scanning*: Perform vulnerability scans monthly
2. *Automatic Updates*: Enable automatic security updates
3. *Software Inventory*: Keep track of installed applications
4. *Access Control*: Maintain principle of least privilege
5. *Backup Strategy*: Regular system and data backups

### Monitoring
1. *Continuous Monitoring*: Set up scheduled scans
2. *Log Review*: Regular security log analysis
3. *Threat Intelligence*: Stay updated on emerging threats
4. *Incident Response*: Have a plan for security incidents

## Interview Preparation Notes

### Key Concepts Covered
1. *Vulnerability Scanning*: Automated security assessment to identify system weaknesses
2. *Risk Assessment*: Process of identifying and evaluating security risks
3. *CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)*: Framework for rating vulnerability severity
4. *Remediation*: Process of fixing identified security issues
5. *False Positives*: Incorrectly identified vulnerabilities that don't actually exist

### Answers to Common Questions
- *Vulnerability vs Penetration Testing*: Scanning identifies potential issues; pen testing actively exploits them
- *Common PC Vulnerabilities*: Outdated software, weak passwords, unpatched OS, malware
- *Scanner Detection Methods*: Signature matching, configuration analysis, version checking
- *Scan Frequency*: Monthly for endpoints, weekly for servers, daily for critical systems
- *Vulnerability Prioritization*: Based on CVSS score, exploitability, business impact
